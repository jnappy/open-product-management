Three types of features 
1. A gamechanger. People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
	- > 3 features is no good; hard to ship; need to blow people away
2. A showstopper. People won’t buy your product if you’re missing this 
feature, but adding it won’t generate demand.
	- put as little effort into these as possible
3. A distraction. This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

- successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. 

"being wrong is ok - be wrong less often than your competitors"

"The sooner you can learn about the history of the space, the state of the technology, the opinions of potential users, and the direction of your competition, the sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for your product."

- write down a product missions; think of it as a function definition that accepts features and returns one of the three bucket classifications; tells you a lot about what the product does, customers, etc

1. reason one to write specs - forces  you to design the program before writing it
2. reason two - saves time communicating 
3. reason three - hard to estimate/make a schedule

Practice writing specs - start a blog, take a creative writing class, anything that will help you put words on a page
