1. ACT SOLID - capture all of the groups that were part of the extended team (Analytics, Communications, Trust/safety, Support, Ops, Legal, International, Design).
2. refer to a company's missions/vission
3. balance: get it right vs. out the door
4. feedback all the time********

Three types of features 
1. A gamechanger. People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
	- > 3 features is no good; hard to ship; need to blow people away
2. A showstopper. People won’t buy your product if you’re missing this 
feature, but adding it won’t generate demand.
	- put as little effort into these as possible
3. A distraction. This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

- successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. 

"being wrong is ok - be wrong less often than your competitors"

"The sooner you can learn about the history of the space, the state of the technology, the opinions of potential users, and the direction of your competition, the sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for your product."

- write down a product missions; think of it as a function definition that accepts features and returns one of the three bucket classifications; tells you a lot about what the product does, customers, etc

1. reason one to write specs - forces  you to design the program before writing it
2. reason two - saves time communicating 
3. reason three - hard to estimate/make a schedule

Practice writing specs - start a blog, take a creative writing class, anything that will help you put words on a page

how to make devs love you: 
1) Listen, Take an Interest in their Work, Be Humble
2) always provide User Stories, Acceptance criteria, Documentation
3) Give them Context, A Clear Vision, Show You’re Calm and the Product is in Control.
	- user stories, sit in on tests, etc all that
4) Take their pain
5) Empathy

"When it comes to the product itself, we are a doctor, prescribing what is best for the health of the product. But when it comes to the product team, I believe we are the mothers. I don’t know about your mother, but the mother’s I know are the framework that holds the house together. The dad might be the authoritarian, but the mother is the nurturer. She holds sway by her influence. The mother’s most powerful and natural gift is that of empathy for her children. And for that empathy she has the devout loyalty of her children."

- Market Requirements Doc - describes the opportunity not the solution 

The purpose of a good product opportunity assessment is either to: 

a) prevent the company from wasting time and money on poor opportunities
b) for those that are good opportunities, to understand what will be required to succeed

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)
2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)
3. How big is the opportunity? (market size)
4. What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)
5. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)
6. Why now? (market window)
7. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)
8. How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)
9. What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)
10. Given the above, what’s the recommendation? (go or no-go)
