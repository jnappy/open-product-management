1. ACT SOLID - capture all of the groups that were part of the extended team (Analytics, Communications, Trust/safety, Support, Ops, Legal, International, Design).
2. refer to a company's missions/vission
3. balance: get it right vs. out the door
4. feedback all the time********

Three types of features 
1. A gamechanger. People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
	- > 3 features is no good; hard to ship; need to blow people away
2. A showstopper. People won’t buy your product if you’re missing this 
feature, but adding it won’t generate demand.
	- put as little effort into these as possible
3. A distraction. This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

- successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. 

"being wrong is ok - be wrong less often than your competitors"

"The sooner you can learn about the history of the space, the state of the technology, the opinions of potential users, and the direction of your competition, the sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for your product."

- write down a product missions; think of it as a function definition that accepts features and returns one of the three bucket classifications; tells you a lot about what the product does, customers, etc

1. reason one to write specs - forces  you to design the program before writing it
2. reason two - saves time communicating 
3. reason three - hard to estimate/make a schedule

Practice writing specs - start a blog, take a creative writing class, anything that will help you put words on a page

how to make devs love you: 
1) Listen, Take an Interest in their Work, Be Humble
2) always provide User Stories, Acceptance criteria, Documentation
3) Give them Context, A Clear Vision, Show You’re Calm and the Product is in Control.
	- user stories, sit in on tests, etc all that
4) Take their pain
5) Empathy

"When it comes to the product itself, we are a doctor, prescribing what is best for the health of the product. But when it comes to the product team, I believe we are the mothers. I don’t know about your mother, but the mother’s I know are the framework that holds the house together. The dad might be the authoritarian, but the mother is the nurturer. She holds sway by her influence. The mother’s most powerful and natural gift is that of empathy for her children. And for that empathy she has the devout loyalty of her children."
